One little job left. The hash containing the word frequencies is ordered based on the first time it sees each word. It would be better to display the results based on the frequencies of the words. We can do that using the hash’s sort_by method. When you use sort_by, you give it a block that tells the sort what to use when making comparisons. In our case, we’ll just use the count. The result of the sort is an array containing a set of two-element arrays, each subarray corresponding to a key/entry pair in the original hash. This makes our whole program
